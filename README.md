# SuperResolution-using-GANs
pytorch implementation of the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf

Dataset used was CelebA. which can be obtained from hhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pWEZsZE9oNnFzTm8.

162770 images were used for training and the rest were used for testing purposes.

This work was done for my Coputer Vision class for the Spring 2019 semester.
The repo is organised in Codes and Results
There is data pre processing, training and testing code available in the codes folder.
The results folder has the best trained model which is at epoch ##. It even has the final presentation which has the results for the work.
